### Welcome to TextDoctor!

TextDoctor is an **AppleScript** app that converts <u>Microsoft Word documents</u> into <u>plain text</u> files! 

What could be more exciting than that! 

Steady on, old chap... There's more...

### Usage

Download the app and move it to your applications folder. 

If you want, you can drag the application icon to your Dock so that it is handy when you need it. 

All you need to start is a folder full of Microsoft Word documents. Hereafter referred to as "The Offending Folder."

When you open the app you'll be asked to choose "The Offending Folder",... full of Microsoft Word documents.

 The first thing TextDoctor does is <u>archive your chosen folder</u> so you don't have to backup of your original files. You'll find the backup archive in the same location as the folder you chose.

Your folder might contain sub-folders full of offending Microsoft Word documents, that's no problem. TextDoctor will look through all the sub-folders inside the folder you choose and convert each one in place into a plain text file.

After the conversions have taken place TextDoctor will delete original Word documents leaving behind only the fresh sparkling text files for you to oggle and enjoy.

**N.B.** If you give TextDoctor a folder with a thousand files to convert it may take several minutes to complete. Your task during this time is to decide whether to <u>mix a martini</u> or <u>eat a bowl of kale soup</u>. TextDoctor is agnostic concerning the outcome of this decision.

### Apple App Authentication

When you first open the TextDoctor you may be confronted with a warning window from Apple saying TextDoctor cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. 

Leave that window open. 

Go to: `Preferences > Security & Privacy > General`. Here you'll see a line at the bottom saying "TextDoctor was blocked from opening... etc." 

Click the "Open Anyway" button.

That's it... You're off to the races... 

However, **if this step was stressful** you may consider pausing for a piece of <u>Blueberry Crumble</u> and a <u>Cuppa Tea</u>.  

> *TextDoctor has been tested with a user who drinks Tetley's English Breakfast and it seemed to work fine for her!*

### Caveat

This project was a quick answer to a friend's problem converting a heap of Word documents to plain text files. If you find it useful, great. 

But there are lots of better solutions!
