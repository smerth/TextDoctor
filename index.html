<p>TextDoctor is an AppleScript App that converts Microsoft Word documents into plain old text files!  What could be more exciting than that!  </p>

<p>Steady on old chap... There's more...</p>

<h3>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h3>

<p>Download the app and move it to your applications folder.  If you want you can drag the application icon to your Dock so that it is handy when you need it. </p>

<p>All you need to start is a folder full of Word documents.  </p>

<p>When you open the app you'll be asked to choose a folder full of Word documents.  The first thing TextDoctor does is archive your chosen folder so you have a backup of your original files.  You'll find the backup archive in the same location as the folder you chose.</p>

<p>Your folder might contain sub-folders full of Word documents, that's no problem.  TextDoctor will look through all the sub-folders inside the folder you choose and convert each one in place into a plain vanilla text file.</p>

<p>After the conversions have taken place TextDoctor will delete original Word documents leaving behind only the fresh sparkling text files for you to enjoy.</p>

<p>N.B. If you give TextDoctor a folder with a thousand files to convert it may take several minutes to complete. Your task during this time is to decide whether to mix a martini or eat a bowl of kale soup.  TextDoctor is agnostic concerning the outcome of this decision.</p>

<p>When you first open the TextDoctor you may be confronted with a warning window from Apple saying TextDoctor cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.  Leave that window open.  Go to: Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General.  Here you'll see a line at the bottom saying "TextDoctor was blocked from opening... etc."  Click the "Open Anyway" button.</p>

<p>That's it... You're off to the races...  However, if this step was stressful you may consider pausing for a piece of Blueberry Crumble and a cuppa tea.  TextDoctor has been tested with user who drink Tetley's English Breakfast and it seems to work fine with them. </p>

<p>This mammoth undertaking would not have been possible without the hard work of generations of programmers I am just one in a long succession of coders working silently, in the dark, a cave off the coast of madagascar...</p>

<h3>
<a id="caveat" class="anchor" href="#caveat" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Caveat</h3>

<p>This project is a quick answer to a friend's problem converting a heap of Word documents to text files.  If you find it useful, great.  But it is really just a favour that addresses a very particular need.  Nothing more.</p>
